**Description:**
Given an array of integers, find the minimal absolute sum of any two elements. Return the minimal absolute sum.

### Examples
Example 1:

Input: numbers = [1, 4, -3]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: numbers = [-8, 4, 5, -10, 3]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: numbers = [2, 2, 2]
Output: 4

Example 4:

Input: numbers = [-1, -2, -3]
Output: 2

Example 5:

Input: numbers = [0, 0]
Output: 0

**Algorithmic Steps**
This problem is solved using a two-pointer approach after sorting:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize two pointers, left at the start and right at the end of the array.
3. While left <= right:
   - Compute the sum of numbers[left] and numbers[right].
   - Update the minimal absolute sum if the current sum is closer to zero.
   - Move the pointer that brings the sum closer to zero.
4. Return the minimal absolute sum found.

**Time and Space complexity:**
- Time complexity: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array (due to sorting).
- Space complexity: `O(1)` (excluding input storage).
