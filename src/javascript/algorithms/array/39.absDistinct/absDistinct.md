**Description:**
Given a sorted array of integers, count the number of distinct absolute values in the array.

### Examples
Example 1:

Input: numbers = [-5, -3, -1, 0, 3, 6]
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: numbers = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 1

Example 4:

Input: numbers = []
Output: 0

**Algorithmic Steps**
This problem is solved using a two-pointer approach and a set:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order (if not already sorted).
2. Initialize two pointers, left at the start and right at the end of the array.
3. While left <= right:
   - Compare the absolute values at left and right.
   - Add the larger absolute value to a set.
   - Move the pointer corresponding to the larger absolute value.
4. Return the size of the set.

**Time and Space complexity:**
- Time complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array (if already sorted; otherwise, `O(n log n)` for sorting).
- Space complexity: `O(n)` in the worst case (for the set).
