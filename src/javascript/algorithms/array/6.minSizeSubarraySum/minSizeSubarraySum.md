**Description:**
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a contiguous
subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,4,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2

#### Example 2:
Input: target = 15, nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 0

### Algorithmic Steps

This problem is efficiently solved using the **sliding window** technique without requiring any special data structures. The approach can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both at `0`. These represent the current window boundaries.
2. Initialize a variable `total` to `0` to keep track of the sum of the current window.
3. Initialize `minLength` to a very large number (e.g., infinity) to represent the length of the smallest valid subarray found so far.
4. Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer:
   - Add `nums[right]` to `total`.
   - While `total` is greater than or equal to `target`:
     - Update `minLength` to the smaller value between the current `minLength` and the window size (`right - left + 1`).
     - Subtract `nums[left]` from `total` and move the `left` pointer forward to try and find a smaller valid window.
5. Continue until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.
6. If `minLength` is still infinity (meaning no valid subarray was found), return `0`. Otherwise, return `minLength`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  The array is traversed at most twice (once by each pointer), resulting in linear time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  No additional data structures are used; only a fixed number of variables are maintained.
